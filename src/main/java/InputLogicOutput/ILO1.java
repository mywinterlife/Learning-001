// QUESTIONS:
// 1. What type is hoursPerDay after the division?
//  Answer: double
// 2. What happens if you use 7 instead of 7.0?
//  Answer: Integer division: 10 รท 7 = 1 - It truncates, and you lose Data!
// 3. Why char for difficulty instead of String?
//Notes:
//#1
//#2
//What happens if you use 7 instead of 7.0?
//Integer division: 10 รท 7 = 1 (truncates)
//Then 1 gets converted to 1.0 for storage
//You lose the decimal precision!
//Division type depends on operands, not storage variable!
//inPractice
//int hoursPerWeek = 10;
//double method1 = hoursPerWeek / 7;    // Why does this give 1.0?
//double method2 = hoursPerWeek / 7.0;  // Why does this give 1.428...?
//// Answer: Integer division vs decimal division happens BEFORE storage!
